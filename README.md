# Challenge-Unit-1

## Description

This challenge assignment was the first homework for the GT Bootcamp (Unit 1). I was provided a starter code and was instructed to make the following changes:

* Add semantic HTML elements to the code
* Ensure the elements follow a logical structure
* Add the alt attributes to the image elements
* Ensure the heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Add a concise and descriptive title to the HTML file

After making the above changes to the starter code provided to me, I pushed them into my own repo, which you are currently in. The below screenshot is how my webpage currently looks.
